This project demonstrates the strategy design pattern using Java and Spring Boot. The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime. In this project, different payment services (such as credit card, PayPal, etc.) can be implemented and dynamically chosen based on the context, following the Strategy pattern.

### Project Overview
- **Language & Framework:** Java with Spring Boot.
- **Purpose:** To illustrate how the strategy pattern can be used for payment service selection, making the application flexible and extensible for different payment methods.

### Key Features
- Implements the Strategy pattern to decouple payment method logic from the core payment processing.
- Makes it easy to add new payment methods without modifying the existing codebase.
- Uses Spring Boot for easy setup and dependency injection.

### How It Works
1. **Strategy Interface:** Defines a common interface for all payment strategies (e.g., pay(), refund()).
2. **Concrete Strategies:** Each payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.) implements the strategy interface with its specific logic.
3. **Context Class:** Uses a strategy instance to execute the payment method. The context can switch between different strategies at runtime.

### Running the Project
- Requires JDK 17 and Maven 3.
- You can run the application from your IDE by executing the main class:  
  `com.ug.paymentservicestrategy.PaymentServiceStrategyApplication`
- Alternatively, use these commands in your terminal:
  ```shell
  mvn clean install
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

### Use Cases
- Payment gateways that support multiple payment methods.
- Applications that need to easily extend or modify payment logic with minimal code changes.
