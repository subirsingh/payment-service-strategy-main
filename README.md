# Payment Service Strategy

This project demonstrates a payment processing service using the Strategy Pattern in a Spring Boot application. It provides an extensible architecture for integrating multiple payment methods (such as credit cards, PayPal, etc.) by encapsulating each payment strategy separately, making the system easy to expand and maintain.

Key features:
- Clean implementation of the Strategy Design Pattern in Java with Spring Boot.
- Easily add or modify payment strategies without changing existing code.
- Example code and instructions to run and test the service locally.

Ideal for developers seeking to learn or apply design patterns in real-world Spring Boot projects.
